# JavaChess
Chess written in java. It's not much but it's honest work

## Planned features:
  - Online multiplayer
  - Board editor
  - Chess engine support
  - Something like that right click planning thing in lichess
  - Maybe a browser version idk

## To do:
  - GUI is broken and someone needs to fix it 
  - The gameplay is not turn based at all
  - Chack and checkmate
  - Build via gradle

### Known gui issues:
  - Chess pieces flickering (WIP)
  - The background doubles as ms paint (Kinda sorta fixed with a band aid)
  - You can lose ***some*** of the pieces in the background

We seriously need a front end guy
