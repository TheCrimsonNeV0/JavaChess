# JavaChess
Chess written in java

## Planned features:
  - Multiplayer support via a client and a server
  - Graphical User Interface
  - Figuring out how we program the king, en passant and pawn promotion in

## To do:
  - GUI is broken and someone needs to fix it 
  - The gameplay is not turn based at all

##Known gui issues:
  - Chess pieces flickering
  - The background doubles as ms paint
  - You can lose ***some*** of the pieces in the background
